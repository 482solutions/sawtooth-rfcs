The Core subteam shepherds technical RFCs through the RFC process, and makes
technical governance decisions; technical topics include those related to the
design and architecture of Sawtooth. This team is responsible for ensuring
long-term architectural consistency with the existing Sawtooth code and overall
project direction adopted by the Root subteam.

The Core subteam is the default subteam for technical decisions in absence of
another appropriate subteam.
